// can't make union on NULL graph
node_t a = NULL;
lexer__literal(&a, "\"a\"");
node_t t = NULL;
lexer__union(&t, &a); -> segv
-- no general fix (empty set union graph is base case) -> assert dst not NULL
-- or create new node and copy everything but that is the same as lexer__copy

i tried using avl with existential quantifier like it was a path (see state__equ ae__access in lexer)
